How to run HPP in docker
========================

== Introduction

docker containers do not always interact properly with 3D visualization and
window management. Trying to run the same image on different machines, we have
experienced wrong behaviors, from graphical interfaces where the button do not
appear to crashes when starting 3D visualization.

To make your HPP experience more robust, we use VNC (Virtual Network Computing)
to forward X display from the docker container to your favorite web browser on
your host machine.

== Installation

=== docker

First, you need to install docker on your machine. Go to https://docs.docker.com/engine/install, select your OS and follow the instructions.

=== docker image

Download the docker image
[source, bash]
----
docker pull gitlab.laas.fr:4567/humanoid-path-planner/hpp-doc/hpp-4.10
----

In a terminal (under Linux and MacOS, for Windows, there should be a graphical
interface), type
[source, bash]
----
docker run --rm -it -p 6080:6080 --name hpp gitlab.laas.fr:4567/humanoid-path-planner/hpp-doc/hpp-4.10
----

This starts a docker container and creates a VNC server inside.

In a web browser, open the following URL: http://localhost:6080/vnc.html?host=localhost&port=6080, and click on "Connect" without entering any password.

You should see the following window:

Open a terminal by right clicking in the window and run
[source, bash]
