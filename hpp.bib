    abstract = { We present a review and reformulation of manifold constrained sampling-based motion planning within a unifying framework, IMACS (implicit manifold configuration space). IMACS enables a broad class of motion planners to plan in the presence of manifold constraints, decoupling the choice of motion planning algorithm and method for constraint adherence into orthogonal choices. We show that implicit configuration spaces defined by constraints can be presented to sampling-based planners by addressing two key fundamental primitives, sampling and local planning, and that IMACS preserves theoretical properties of probabilistic completeness and asymptotic optimality through these primitives. Within IMACS, we implement projection- and continuation-based methods for constraint adherence, and demonstrate the framework on a range of planners with both methods in simulated and realistic scenarios. Our results show that the choice of method for constraint adherence depends on many factors and that novel combinations of planners and methods of constraint adherence can be more effective than previous approaches. Our implementation of IMACS is open source within the Open Motion Planning Library and is easily extended for novel planners and constraint spaces. }

Our algorithm tunes the quality of its solution based on available search time, at every step reusing previous search efforts. When updated information regarding the underlying graph is received, the algorithm incrementally repairs its previous solution. The result is an approach that combines the benefits of anytime and incremental planners to provide efficient solutions to complex, dynamic search problems. We present theoretical analysis of the algorithm, experimental results on a simulated robot kinematic arm, and two current applications in dynamic path planning for outdoor mobile robots.},

This task is integral to many robotic applications, such as vacuum cleaning robots, painter robots, autonomous underwater vehicles creating image mosaics, demining robots, lawn mowers, automated harvesters, window cleaners and inspection of complex structures, just to name a few. A considerable body of research has addressed the CPP problem. However, no updated surveys on CPP reflecting recent advances in the field have been presented in the past ten years. In this paper, we present a review of the most successful CPP methods, focusing on the achievements made in the past decade. Furthermore, we discuss reported field applications of the described CPP methods. This work aims to become a starting point for researchers who are initiating their endeavors in CPP. Likewise, this work aims to present a comprehensive review of the recent breakthroughs in the field, providing links to the most interesting and successful works."

    abstract = { This paper addresses the problem of planning the motion of one or more pursuers in a polygonal environment to eventually "see" an evader that is unpredictable, has unknown initial position, and is capable of moving arbitrarily fast. This problem was first introduced by Suzuki and Yamashita. Our study of this problem is motivated in part by robotics applications, such as surveillance with a mobile robot equipped with a camera that must find a moving target in a cluttered workspace. A few bounds are introduced, and a complete algorithm is presented for computing a successful motion strategy for a single pursuer. For simply-connected free spaces, it is shown that the minimum number of pursuers required is Θ(lg n). For multiply-connected free spaces, the bound is \$\Theta(\sqrt{h}+ {\rm lg} n)\$ pursuers for a polygon that has n edges and h holes. A set of problems that are solvable by a single pursuer and require a linear number of recontaminations is shown. The complete algorithm searches a finite graph that is constructed on the basis of critical information changes. It has been implemented and computed examples are shown. }

Math., in press], of the following problem, which arises in robotics: Given a collection of bodies B, which may be hinged, i.e., may allow internal motion around various joints, and given a region bounded by a collection of polyhedral or other simple walls, decide whether or not there exists a continuous motion connecting two given positions and orientations of the whole collection of bodies. We show that this problem can be handled by appropriate refinements of methods introduced by A. Tarski [“A Decision Method for Elementary Algebra and Geometry,” 2nd ed., Univ. of Calif. Press, Berkeley, 1951] and G. Collins [in “Second GI Conference on Automata Theory and Formal Languages,” Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Vol. 33, pp. 134–183, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1975], which lead to algorithms for this problem which are polynomial in the geometric complexity of the problem for each fixed number of degrees of freedom (but exponential in the number of degrees of freedom). Our method, which is also related to a technique outlined by J. Reif [in “Proceedings, 20th Symposium on the Foundations of Computer Science,” pp. 421–427, 1979], also gives a general (but not polynomial time) procedure for calculating all of the homology groups of an arbitrary real algebraic variety. Various algorithmic issues concerning computations with algebraic numbers, which are required in the algorithms presented in this paper, are also reviewed."
